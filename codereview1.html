<p>Growing up, I always admired my dad's art work and strived to be like him. I wanted to draw newspaper comic books, write long poems, and work at a design company just like him. I quickly learned that dreams are just that; if not actively pursued.</p>
 <p>At the age of eleven I saved up to buy myself a small, $40 digital camera. Since then, I've fallen in love with the craft of photography, and have discovered my love for it sits residually in the analog side of it. I work slowly and methodically; paralleling the tedious art of shooting film. I've spent countless hours locked in numerous bathrooms, where one's only company is the scent of the fumes, and the feeble safe light precariously hung fron the shower curtain rod. I strive to only put in the highest quality and effort into my work, and hope that this may be a place where one can interact and experience my art remotely.
