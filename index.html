  <h1>about myself</h1>
<div class="max"><img src="img/max.jpg" alt="max" width="300"></div>
<p>Growing up, I always admired my dad's art work and strived to be like him. I wanted to draw newspaper comic books, write long poems, and work at a design company just like him. I quickly learned that dreams are just that; if not actively pursued.</p>
 <p>At the age of eleven I saved up to buy myself a small, $40 digital camera. Since then, I've fallen in love with the craft of photography, and have discovered my love for it sits residually in the analog side of it. I work slowly and methodically; paralleling the tedious art of shooting film. I've spent countless hours locked in numerous bathrooms, where one's only company is the scent of the fumes, and the feeble safe light precariously hung fron the shower curtain rod. I strive to only put in the highest quality and effort into my work, and hope that this may be a place where one can interact and experience my art remotely.
</p>
<p>I decided I would combine my favorite aspects of photography <span class="span">design, layout, etc) </span>(with a growing job market: web programming! That's what brought me to <strong>Epicodus</strong>, where I now am studying in an Intro to Programming class, and anticipate moving into their full stack engineer course. I hope to graduate and soon lock up a job in front end user interface design. Fingers crossed! </p>

<h3><div class="heading_3"><strong>Projects</strong></div></h3>
<p>Below are links to numerous coding projects I've been working on! They range in completion and seriousness, but are below to check out if you feel so inclined.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kdrendel99/My-first-website">My First Website </a></li>
    <p>The My First Website repository I made contains two websites, ironically enough. The first is truly my first website that has a <em>very<em> charasmatic frog, and the second is a website dedicated to my favorite things. Both use HTML and CSS elements, and are pretty basic so far.</p>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kdrendel99/shelter.repo">A Colorful Animal Shelter</a></li>
    <p>This website is an vibrant animal shelter page I made with Daisy and Derek, my collegues. We had some fun with it and worked together to create a light-heared animal adoption page implementing our understanding of HTML and CSS.</p>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kdrendel99/Cookie-Recipie">A link to Some Delicious Cookies</a></li>
    <a>A fun cookie recipie that I practiced cloning from an Epicodus lesson. I used HTML in this project.</a>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kdrendel99/hello-world/blob/main/hello-world.html">My First Experiment with HTML</a></li>
    <p> My very first website I've built, per guidance of the Epicodus curriculum. This uses basic HTML.</p>
